            I am an experienced marketing professional with over 8 years of expertise in marketing strategy, sales support, and campaign management. Having worked as the Head of Marketing at Pesti HÃ¡zak Zrt., I led a team of 5-6 people, managing both B2C and B2B marketing strategies. My work resulted in selling nearly 1,000 apartments across Budapest and significantly improving company operations and profitability through optimized processes and strategic partnerships.

            Throughout my career, I have focused on project management, system implementations, and performance optimization. I introduced the Salesforce marketing and sales support system, facilitated a joint project with Codic International SA, and launched award-winning campaigns that contributed to business growth. I have also been responsible for managing high-budget campaigns, including SEM, social media, and offline channels, ensuring brand consistency and market reach.

            In addition to my extensive marketing experience, I am continuously improving my technical skills. I am currently learning HTML coding, and I built this multi-page website as part of my development. This website is written entirely by me using HTML5, as of September 26, 2024.
